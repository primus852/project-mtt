In order to find the most suitable algorithm for translating a live input stream of American SLA to any other suitable SLA (sharing the same alphabet) in a real-world application, the algorithm needs to excel in two main aspects: accuracy and inference time. A third factor that may come into question here is the training time, as computational cost may accumulate when further improving the model in the future.
