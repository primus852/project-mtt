Every country has its own sign language. There is no universal sign language in the world to help deaf people communicate with others from other countries. This project focuses on developing a Sign Language Alphabet (SLA) translator that can play an important role by not only its interpretation but also helping deaf people to communicate with each other without learning a new sign language. In this project, the sign language used for training detective models is American sign language, and the detective models were imported from pre-trained models for transfer learning in the Keras library. The best six models, VGG16, ResNet50V2, MobileNet, MobileNetV2, DenseNet201, and Xception were selected by comparing the performance of the partial learning to further use these models for training of the entire training dataset. After the training of the full training dataset, the six models were compared for accuracy and inference time and the result was MobileNet with an inference time as fast as 0.03 seconds and an accuracy of 99.68\%. The test dataset was further detected using this MobileNet model and the detected results were mapped to Turkish sign language images for translation.
