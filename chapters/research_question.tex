\subsection{Problem Statement}
The previous works showed great achievements in translating American SLA to texts by capturing images through cameras and using CNN for feature extraction and classification. However, an SLA translator from American SLA to other SLA is still not available today which would solve the international communication of people. The challenge lies in identifying a detector which is delivers a high accuracy and fast predictions at the same time.

\subsection{Objective}
The goal for this research question aims to develop an SLA translator that uses optimal transfer learning for Object Detection to recognise images of American SLAs and translate them into Turkish SLAs with images. For example, the American alphabet P in sign language is recognised and translated into the Turkish alphabet P in sign language. The main focus will be to find a model that balances accuracy such as inference time.
