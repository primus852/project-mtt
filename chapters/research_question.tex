\subsection{Problem Statement}
The previous works mentioned in the previous chapter showed great achievements in translating American SLA to texts by capturing images through cameras and using CNN for feature extraction and classification. However, an SLA translator from American SLA to other SLA is still not available today, which would solve the international communication of people without learning a new SLA. However, the challenge lies in identifying a detective model that delivers both high accuracy and fast inference time.

\subsection{Objective}
This research question aims to develop an SLA translator that uses optimal transfer learning for Object Detection to recognize images of American SLAs and translate them into Turkish SLAs with images. For example, the American letter P in sign language is recognized and translated into the Turkish letter P in sign language. The main focus will be to determine the most suitable model that potentially has both high accuracy and efficient inference time in real-time application.
