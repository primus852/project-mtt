One of the main benefits of using transfer learning is to make use of previously trained models and save computational cost (CC) for basic tasks like the removal of background. It may also be used when the training data is sparse. For the detection of American SLA we may use (to a degree) any pre-trained model for object detection on our dataset of American SLA signs even if they are limited in count and quality, as they only make the last layer of our final model.
